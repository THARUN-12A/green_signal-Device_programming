# Air Pollution Based Traffic Signal Management System

## Project Overview
This project focuses on managing traffic signals based on air pollution levels at an intersection where four routes are connected. The aim is to reduce pollution and improve traffic flow using smart sensors and signal management.

## Key Features
1. **Sensor Integration**:
   - Sensors are installed on all four roads leading to the traffic signal.
   - These sensors measure air pollution levels in real time.

2. **Smart Signal Control**:
   - The traffic signal processes data from the sensors.
   - The road with the highest pollution levels is given a green light to allow vehicles, especially bikes, to move and reduce congestion.

3. **Traffic Safety**:
   - Traffic police ensure a safe flow of vehicles by directing paths to avoid collisions.

## How It Works
1. **Sensor Data Collection**:
   - Pollution sensors on each road continuously monitor air quality.

2. **Signal Decision**:
   - The traffic signal analyzes the pollution data.
   - The road with the highest pollution gets the green light.

3. **Traffic Management**:
   - Vehicles on the selected road move first to reduce pollution buildup.
   - Traffic police assist in managing the flow safely.

## Benefits
- Reduces air pollution by prioritizing highly polluted routes.
- Decreases traffic congestion.
- Promotes smoother and safer traffic management.

## Technologies Used
- Air Pollution Sensors
- Traffic Signal Systems
- Real-Time Data Processing
- Safety Mechanisms for Traffic Flow

## How to Use
1. Install the sensors and traffic signal system as per the project setup.
2. Ensure the sensors are calibrated to measure pollution levels accurately.
3. Activate the system to monitor pollution and manage traffic signals.
4. Coordinate with traffic police for smooth and safe vehicle movement.

## Future Scope
- Integration with IoT for remote monitoring and control.
- Real-time data analysis and reporting.
- Expansion to include more parameters like noise pollution and vehicle density.

This project offers an innovative solution to address air pollution and traffic congestion, creating a cleaner and more efficient traffic system.
